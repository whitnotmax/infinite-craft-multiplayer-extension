# create-react-chrome-extension

**I removed a bunch of stuff like client side routing that I didn't want, and configured content scripts to also be compiled by webpack in order to inject React components into a webpage (see src/content.js) for a project I may or may not end up actually finishing :)**

create-react-chrome-extension is a template for building Chrome and Firefox extensions using React and state-of-the-art settings. This project aims to provide a solid starting point for developers looking to create browser extensions with modern web technologies.

Consider giving it a ⭐️ if you like it to show your support!

## Features

- **React**: Build your extension's UI with the popular JavaScript library.
- **State-of-the-art settings**: The template is configured with the latest best practices in mind.
- **Support for Chrome and Firefox**: Develop extensions that are compatible with two of the most widely used web browsers.

## Getting Started
